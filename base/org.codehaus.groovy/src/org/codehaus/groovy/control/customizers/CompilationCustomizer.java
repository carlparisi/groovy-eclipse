/**
 * This is a 'stub' class inserted into Groovy 1.7 bundle so that it is 'compilation and classload
 * compatible' with Groovy 1.8 bundle, with respect to external code referencing ImportCustomizer.
 * <p>
 * This class is copied because it is the superclass of ImportCustomizer and some Greclipse code
 * references the getPhase method inherited from here.
 * <p>
 * This is intended to *not* actually be used in Groovy 1.7 so any attempt to actually instantiate
 * an instance of this class or call methods in it will cause a IllegalStateException. 
 * <p>
 * This class was created by copying CompilationCustomizer from Groovy 1.8 and replacing all public
 * API with a stub method that throws IllegalStateException.
